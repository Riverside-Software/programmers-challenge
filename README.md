## EMEA PUG Challenge: Programmer's Challenge

We have a server that plays games – specifically Othello (aka Reversi) - and it's bored and lonely.

You write some ABL code that plays Othello by talking to the server using a specific API we provide. During the PUG Challenge, players play games against each other in a tournament that consists of a knockout competition. Preliminary rounds will take place during the PUG Challenge and the final match will take place during a session on Friday at 3pm.

On top of your peers’ recognition, prizes will be offered by Riverside Software
